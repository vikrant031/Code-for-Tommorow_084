# Wikipedia End-to-End Automation Testing with Cypress (Page Object Model)

## About This Repository

This repository contains an end-to-end automation testing solution for <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">**Wikipedia**'s</a> homepage. The tests are implemented using **Cypress** with the **Page Object Model (POM)** for better maintainability and scalability of test scripts.

The primary functionalities tested in this repository include:
- Search Bar Functionality
- Preferred Languages Selection Dropdown
- Verifying Links

This repository includes automated tests to ensure the correctness of these features, along with associated documentation for the testing process.

## Tech Stack

This project uses the following tech stack:

- **Cypress**: JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework for web applications.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for writing test scripts.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Design pattern used to separate the test logic from the page structure and make tests more maintainable.
- **Mocha/Chai**: Testing frameworks used with Cypress for assertions and organizing tests.
- **GitHub Actions**: For Continuous Integration (CI) to run automated tests on each code push.
